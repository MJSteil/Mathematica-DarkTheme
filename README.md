# Mathematica-DarkTheme

This repository includes a *Mathematica* stylesheet `DarkTheme.nb` including a dark themed *style/screen environment* named *WorkingDark*
which can be switched on and off using either the menu `Format->Screen Environment->...` or the command `SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],ScreenStyleEnvironment->"..."]`.
The same stylesheet is embedded as private style definitions in the notebook `Nootebook_DarkTheme_embedded.nb` which can be used without installing the stylesheet.

## Installation
Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/MJSteil/Mathematica-DarkTheme.git`
and/or add `DarkTheme.nb` to the folder `$UserBaseDirectory\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\StyleSheets` or use/modify `Nootebook_DarkTheme_embedded.nb` to use the embedded version of the stylesheet, which does not require installation.
